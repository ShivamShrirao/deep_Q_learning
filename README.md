# deep_Q_learning

Got inspiration from watching this video https://youtu.be/rFwQDDbYTm4 and reading the paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602.pdf) right now.

Plan is to make it from scratch from understanding of paper in my own library. https://github.com/ShivamShrirao/dnn_from_scratch

Using OpenAI gym as game environment.
